* All tests
These tests should be free of ugly artifacts no matter what! Many tests have associated .xcf's (gimp files) with a hidden layer that contains a previous good-looking render of the AO, so matching that is a good goal.

* test1
This test contains two creased blocks of different color. The red block's color should bleed pleasantly onto the gray block and vice versa.

* test2
This test contains the blocks from test1, but with no creases, and subdivided twice. The red block's color should again bleed pleasantly onto the gray.

* test3
This test contains the blocks from test1, but with no creases, and not subdivided. This is to test the behavior of large, uncreased faces.

* test4
This test contains the red and gray blocks, but they have been welded together. Since they are not creased, the red may not be necessarily bleeding onto the gray.

* test5
This test contains the welded red and gray blocks, but they have been creased. The creased version should bleed the red onto the gray.

* test6
This test contains a bunch of strange geometry designed to test backface blacking and independent meshes. The pyramids should cast black shadows on the plane below, and the curved plane should cast a grayish red shadow on itself and on the pyramids.

* head4.sia
Smooth cranium without faceting

* occ_test.obj
Inward-facing polygons should work with raytracing and tri distance, and concave polygons.

* beveled box (UVd)
A small box that has some faces that are pure white that DevIL will output as pure black due to integer overfow if it is handled improperly.
